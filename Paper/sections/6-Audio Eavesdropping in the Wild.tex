To demonstrate the real-world severity of Injection-Induced Side Channels, we conducted end-to-end attacks on widely deployed consumer and office electronics. This section evaluates the vulnerability of these devices in Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) scenarios, specifically targeting the post-decryption analog stages that bypass conventional digital security measures.

\subsection{Analog Vulnerability in Wireless Headphones}

Before conducting the in-the-wild attack, we analyzed the physical layout of the target wireless headphones (UGreen Max2) to understand the root cause of the leakage. Teardowns reveal that while the Bluetooth SoC is shielded, the analog output wires connecting the internal DAC/Amplifier to the dynamic drivers are completely unshielded and run along the headband or ear cup circumference. These wires, typically 10-15 cm in length, effectively act as unintentional antennas. Crucially, they carry the demodulated, baseband analog audio after the Bluetooth stack has performed decryption. This creates a "Post-Decryption" vulnerability window where the non-linearity of the driving amplifier allows our injected carrier to pick up the audio signal before it becomes sound waves, rendering the Bluetooth protocol's encryption irrelevant to physical-layer adversaries.

We validated this threat in a realistic "through-wall" espionage scenario where the victim participated in a confidential conference call within a standard meeting room. The adversary was stationed in an adjacent room, separated by a 20 cm solid concrete wall at a straight-line distance of approximately 1 meter. \cref{fig:spectrum_home} illustrates the secret signal spectrum, where injection-induced sidebands remain clearly distinguishable above the noise floor despite the concrete barrier. Furthermore, it can be observed that the denoising algorithm proposed in \cref{sec:design} further highlights the spectral features of the sound. 

To assess robustness against dynamic user behavior, we swept the playback volume from a quiet office level of 60 dB to a louder entertainment level of 80 dB. As shown in \cref{fig:impact_volume}, the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) of the recovered leakage exhibits a positive correlation with the playback volume. Crucially, even at the lower volume of 65 dB typical of private calls, the attack maintained a Word Error Rate (WER) low enough to recover intelligible speech, confirming that physical isolation by standard building materials fails to guarantee privacy against active EM injection.

\subsection{Active Closed-Loop Manipulation of Fixed Phone}

Beyond passive eavesdropping, injection-induced side channels enable a novel ``Listen-Decide-Act'' kill chain that elevates the threat from confidentiality compromise to active integrity manipulation. We demonstrated this capability on a Flyingvoice P23GW landline phone through a closed-loop attack framework.

The attack begins with \textit{context awareness}, where the adversary continuously monitors the leakage from the landline. By synchronizing the remote party's voice—recovered via the injection-induced side channel—with the local victim's voice captured by a directional acoustic microphone, the system maintains a full, real-time contextual understanding of the conversation.

Upon detecting specific trigger keywords sucha as``password'' or ``confirmation'', the system instantly transitions to the \textit{decision and generation} phase. A voice cloning module (IndexTTS-2), having been silently trained on a brief sample of the remote colleague's voice captured during the monitoring phase, generates a context-appropriate deep-fake response.

Finally, the system executes the \textit{active deception} by switching the Software Defined Radio (SDR) from continuous wave (CW) monitoring mode to high-power Amplitude Modulation (AM) injection mode. The malicious audio clip is injected onto the cable, where the non-linear junction of the phone acts as an unintended demodulator. This process forces the fake audio to be played directly into the victim's ear, indistinguishable from the legitimate call audio, thereby completing the active manipulation loop.

We executed a portable "Man-in-the-Middle" style attack using a suitcase-integrated platform positioned in a public hallway at a distance of 50 cm from the victim across a 20~cm office wall. In our attack experiment,  The "Man-in-the-Middle" injection was successful in 9 out of 10 trials. We observed that the non-linearity of the Flyingvoice P23GW is sufficient to demodulate the injected AM signal at the victim's ear causing no suspicion.
